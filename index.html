<h2><p class="Carp Tasks">During the designing procedure of the CARP Task, as I do not have very good concept when inspiration, I could only try to design them by 
    following one principle which usually used for programming: KISS principle. The KISS principle stands for "Keep It Simple, Stupid", it reminds designers to 
    design everything as simple as possible but including every critial elements.

<p><img src="Typography Task/untitled.png" alt="Typography Task"></a> </p>

<h2><p class="Typography Task reflection paragraph">When I was working on this task, I have also researched the designs which related to the 8 typographic design through
    the internet, which has inspired me to complete the task by using Radial system. As a result, it is a simple design but fairly organized.
