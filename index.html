<p><img src="CARP Task/4th design-1.png" alt="1st Design"></a> </p>
<p><img src="CARP Task/5th design-1.png" alt="1st Design"></a> </p>
<p><img src="CARP Task/6th design-1.png" alt="1st Design"></a> </p>

<h2><p class="Reflection paragraph">During the designing procedure of the CARP Task, as I do not have very good concept when inspiration, I could only try to design them by 
    following one principle which usually used for programming: KISS principle. The KISS principle stands for "Keep It Simple, Stupid", it reminds designers to 
    design everything as simple as possible but including every critial elements.

<h4>Typography Task</h4>
<p>Here is my Typography Task</p>
<p><img src="Typography Task/untitled.png" alt="Typography Task"></a> </p>

<h2><p class="Reflection paragraph">When I was working on this task, I have also researched the designs which related to the 8 typographic design through
    the internet, which has inspired me to complete the task by using Radial system. As a result, it is a simple design but fairly organized.

<h4>Coding Task</h4>
<p>Here is my Coding Tasks</p>
<p><a href="wk1-ws/index.html" target = "_blank"> Week 1 task</a></p>
<p><a href="wk2&3-ws/index.html" target = "_blank"> Week 2&3 task</a></p>
<p>Unfortunatelly I have lost the original files of the Week 4 task, I am very sorry for that.</p>
<p class = "Reflection paragraph">The coding task is being done in every week, in week 1 I was just learning how to create a html page with 
    typing "Hello World", which is the most common sentence which people typed when they are programming first time, it is also a very meaningful sentence 
    because this sentence is usually applied for making a demo for how a programming language used, and has the program be installed properly. In week 2 we 
    have learned about adding contents into the page such as texts and images, also linking another html page into the current page. I have combined the week 3 task 
    into week 2 task, the reason for that is because week 3 is about learning how to use css to styling the html page. Therefore, I combined week 2 and week 3 tasks in the 
    same folder. I have commited all these tasks I got into my github repository.

<h4>User Experience Task</h4>
<p>For the User experience, I was considering should I design the website as a single-scroll website or interactable website which has buttons to change to different
    contents, however I am heavily inspired by the apple and playstation website, therefore this whole website is designed as a single-scroll website. As my priority user 
    is Professor Mary Jackson, an interactable website will definitely gain more marks in the point of view of myself, but when I looked at the apple and playstation website,
    especially in the pages with specific product, they have decided to use single-scroll website too. By using single-scroll design, it is more likely to be simple but including
    a much more modern design. 
</p>
<p>Comparing Single-Scroll website and Interactable website, it does rely on user preferences and the device user used to view the website. When the user is using smartphones
    to view a Single-Scroll website, it will be relatively easier because all they need to do is to keep scrolling the page and they do not require any further movement of
    their fingers, and this also suits user who uses PC or laptop to view the website. However viewing an Interactable website requires more movement of user's hands, and for 
    some user like professor Stephen William Hawking, who has difficulty on moving their body or hands, it is definitely giving a terrible user experience for them.
